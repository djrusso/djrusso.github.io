<h2>About Me </h2>
<p>I joined the <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations">Decision, Risk, and Operations division</a> of the Columbia Business School in Summer 2017. I teach a core MBA course on statistics and a PhD course on dynamic optimization. My research lies at the intersection of statistical machine learning and online decision making, mostly falling under the broad umbrella of reinforcement learning.
Outside academia, I work with Spotify to apply reinforcement learning and large language models to audio recommendations.  </p>
<p>My research has been recognized by the Frederick W. Lanchester Prize, a Junior Faculty Interest Group Best Paper Award, and first place in the George Nicholson Student Paper Competition. I currently serve as an associate editor at Management Science, Operations Research, and Stochastic Systems.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Columbia, I spent one great year  as an assistant professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management
and one year at Microsoft Research in New England as Postdoctoral Researcher. I received my PhD  from Stanford University in 2015, where I was advised by <a href="http://engineering.stanford.edu/profile/bvr">Benjamin Van Roy</a>.
In 2011 I received my BS in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Michigan. </p>
